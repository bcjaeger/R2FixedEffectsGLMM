# R2FixedEffectsGLMM

Code from R2 for Fixed Effects in the GLMM by Jaeger et. al.

These files can be used to generate the results in my paper, 'An R^2 Statistic for Fixed Effects in the GLMM.'

The functions to compute the R^2_\beta statistic may also be used by anyone to assess goodness-of-fit for a proposed GLMM in R or SAS. Please see (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.3429/abstract) for more on R^2_\beta.
